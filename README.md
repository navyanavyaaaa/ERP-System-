# ERP-System-
This project is a university course registration system developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It allows students, professors, administrators, and teaching assistants to perform various role-specific functionalities such as course registration, grade management, feedback submission, and complaint handling.
This code exercises generic programming, object classes, inheritance, and exception handling all together into an overall system for course management and user interaction. The key class in the overall system is Feedback, relying on generic programming in order to allow for different sorts of feedback: numerical rating or text-based feedback without requiring separate classes. This makes it possible to reuse the class with various types of feedback, which ensures code reusability and flexibility.
 The User  class is the abstract base class for the student types: students, professors, or admins. Each type of user inherits generalized attributes and methods from the User  class while simultaneously having its own attributes and methods. This inheritance hierarchy will enable code reuse and help to build specific user classes with distinctive properties. For instance, the Student class would have attributes and methods that deal with course enrollments, tracking grades, and giving feedbacks. However, a Professor class would have attributes and methods that are concerned with course management, grading students, and viewing feedback.

The code also employs exception handling to handle exceptional events-such as when a student tries to sign up for a course that has reached its maximum number of students. It does this by defining a custom exception class named CourseFullException. This exception gets thrown every time a student tries to enroll in a full course-which is caught and handled in the Student class by showing the student an error message to let him know. This approach ensures that the system remains robust and manages the unforeseen situations with a well-controlled manner.

It represents real-world entities such as courses, students, professors, and administrators through classes of objects. A class of object includes attributes and methods that characterize the feature and behavior of the corresponding real-world. For example, the class of Course has course code, name, credits, and enrollment limit as attributes together with methods for enrolling students and updating course details.

It also makes use of inheritance to declare a class hierarchy for the user classes. The class User  is declared as the superclass. This inheritance hierarchy helps in avoiding the duplication of codes and enables the generation of classes with unique characteristics. The system also uses exception handling in handling unforeseen situations such as when the student attempts to enroll in a course which is already full.

The above code, in general, will be representing the thoughtful and structured approach to designing the big system managing courses and user interactions. Upon the use of generic programming, object classes, inheritance, and exceptions, the system provides a powerful and flexible framework in managing complex interactions between the users and courses.
