This project is a university course registration system developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It allows students, professors, administrators, and teaching assistants to perform various role-specific functionalities such as course registration, grade management, feedback submission, and complaint handling. The system incorporates advanced features like a generic feedback mechanism, enhanced role management through inheritance, and robust exception handling for scenarios like invalid login, course registration failures, and late course drops. Designed as a terminal-based, menu-driven program, this project demonstrates the practical application of OOP principles, including encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and exception handling, to solve real-world problems effectively.
